            us and shall prevail over your own terms and conditions. You agree
            that in entering into this agreement, you shall not rely on any
            representation or understanding, whether oral or in writing, which
            is not included or referred to in these terms and conditions.{" "}

            or in written proposals. 3. We shall produce one master copy of the
            production only for your use. Should you require further copies an
            additional charge will apply. A separate quotation will be issued
            for the production of additional copies. 4. Times given for delivery
            of the Service are estimates only and time shall not be of the
            essence.
